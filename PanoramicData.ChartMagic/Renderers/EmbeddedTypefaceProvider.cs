/// Supplies the font ChartMagic draws text with, from a copy embedded in this assembly.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Issue #60. Without this, charts rendered on Linux contained no text at all - no axis labels,
/// no tick values, no legend text, no titles - while the bars, lines and colours were correct.
///
/// The cause is not missing fonts. Consumers commonly reference
/// <c>SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies</c>, a libSkiaSharp built without fontconfig, and
/// with that build SkiaSharp can enumerate no system fonts whatsoever. Every text node resolves to
/// nothing and draws nothing.
///
/// That failure is unusually well hidden. <c>fc-list</c> and <c>fc-match</c> work perfectly in the
/// same container, because they are fontconfig's own tools and SkiaSharp never consults them - so a
/// font can be installed, aliased and confirmed present, and still be entirely unavailable to the
/// renderer. It also fails silently: a chart missing every label still looks like a chart, so it
/// passes a glance and reaches whoever asked for it unreadable.
///
/// Two fixes that suggest themselves do not work, and both were measured before this one was
/// written. Installing more fonts changes nothing, because the font manager is empty rather than
/// under-stocked. Naming a font-family changes nothing either: an unresolvable family still draws
/// via a fallback, and comma-separated stacks are not honoured at all - "NoSuchFont, Arial" renders
/// identically to "NoSuchFont", not to Arial.
///
/// Carrying the font removes the dependency on the host entirely, so a chart looks the same
/// wherever it is drawn. That is worth having on its own: the alternative leaves output at the
/// mercy of whatever the platform default happens to be, which can change under a SkiaSharp or
/// base-image update without anything appearing to have changed here.
///
/// Liberation Sans is metrically compatible with Arial, so label widths, wrapping and layout match
/// the reference renderer even though the glyph outlines differ very slightly. It is licensed under
/// the SIL Open Font License 1.1, which permits embedding and redistribution; see Fonts/OFL.txt.
